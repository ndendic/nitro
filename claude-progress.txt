# Claude Progress Report - Session 1 (Initializer Agent)
Date: 2025-12-11
Branch: auto-nitro-docs

## MISSION ACCOMPLISHED ✓

Successfully established the foundation for autonomous development of the Nitro Documentation Platform.

## DELIVERABLES

### 1. Feature List (feature_list.json) ✓
- 83 comprehensive test cases covering all aspects of docs platform
- Categories: Core Engine, DocPage Entity, Navigation, Playground, Gallery, Search, Content, Layout, Styling, Performance
- ALL features start with "passes": false
- CRITICAL: Features can ONLY be marked true when complete - NEVER remove or edit

### 2. Environment Setup Script (init.sh) ✓
- 5-step installation process with colored output
- Installs Nitro, verifies imports, configures paths
- Creates docs_app structure, launches FastAPI on port 8000
- Safety features and error handling included

### 3. Git Repository Setup ✓
- Initialized repository on branch: auto-nitro-docs
- First commit (c9b238e): Foundation setup
- All work tracked and committed

### 4. Project Structure ✓
- Discovered existing docs_app with working FastAPI app
- Has Datastar integration, demo pages, static serving
- Created domain/, infrastructure/markdown/, components/ dirs
- Ready for implementation

## NEXT STEPS FOR SESSION 2

1. Implement MarkdownToNitro renderer (Mistletoe)
2. Create DocPage entity with load_from_fs() and render()
3. Build sidebar navigation component
4. Load and render test markdown content

Work on ONE feature at a time from feature_list.json.
Test thoroughly before marking "passes": true.

## FILES TO CREATE NEXT
- infrastructure/markdown/renderer.py
- infrastructure/markdown/plugins.py
- domain/page_model.py
- components/layout.py
- components/sidebar.py

## ENVIRONMENT
Branch: auto-nitro-docs
Status: Clean, committed
Dependencies: All verified
Launch: ./init.sh

Good luck! 🚀

## BONUS: IMPLEMENTATION STARTED

### Discovered Existing Infrastructure ✓
- NitroRenderer already exists in infrastructure/markdown/renderer.py
- Has handlers for most markdown elements
- Minor import issue found (Code -> InlineCode)
- Ready to test and use once fixed

### Next Agent TODO:
1. Fix import in renderer.py (Code -> InlineCode)
2. Test renderer with sample markdown
3. Create DocPage entity in domain/page_model.py
4. Integrate renderer with DocPage.render()
5. Mark first features as "passes": true in feature_list.json

The foundation is even stronger than expected! 
Most markdown rendering is already implemented.
